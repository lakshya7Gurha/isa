The session recording will be available for one quarter post the session. session slide decks will be available to you forever. Think of this like any other online course, with the added magic of meeting and interacting with the people learning with you. To encourage the serendipity that comes out of chances like these, we made this a live-consumption course with the recordings available for only a limited duration. once you enroll, we hope you will make time for this learning experience in your schedule <3`
